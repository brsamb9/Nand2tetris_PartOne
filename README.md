# Nand2tetris Part One [Weeks 1-6: Hardware focused] - https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer
Based on their book: "The Elements of Computing Systems" by Nisan and Schocken.
Concept is to build a computer from NAND gates. This can be decomposed into a hierachy of chip parts, which are abstracted along the way to avoid unnessary confusion.

# tl;dr: Interesting projects
  -> 02 ALU
  -> 03 Memory chips built upon the smaller chips
  -> 05 Assembly of the 'Hack' Computer 
  -> 06 Assembler

# Projects overview:
01 -> Fundamental Logic gates and their boolean logic: Elementary logic gates, 16-bit variants and multi-way varients
02 -> Binary arthimetric and building the ALU
03 -> Memory (from registers to RAM16K chips): Combinatorial logic [from NAND gates] / Sequential logic [from FLIP-FLOP gates]
04 -> 'Hack' Assembly language: 
05 -> Computer architecture: Memory and CPU built from previous projects to assemble the 'Hack' computer.  
06 -> Assembler: High-level language (C++) to translate assembly language into binary.
